The contents of the civetweb subdirectory are from the Civitweb Github
repository on 5 Feb 2021:

URL:  https://github.com/civetweb/civetweb
HASH: ee53d5544a9790a3da2fd71859e60475a2391ee3

This is the minimum contents from that repo for embedding the Civitweb
server in an appication. The build deliberately disables many features
including SSL.

Refer to the upstream repository for documentation, tests, and full source
to have other features enabled.
